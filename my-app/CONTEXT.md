# XPlainit - Project Context & Status

**Last Updated:** October 19, 2025
**Project Status:** In Active Development for HackTX 2025
**Repository:** https://github.com/Poudel-Sanskriti/XPlanet

---

## 🎯 Project Vision

**XPlainit** is an AI-powered financial education platform that reimagines banking by making it transparent and understandable. We combine space-themed exploration with real-world utility—using Google Gemini AI to translate confusing financial jargon into plain English, provide personalized advice, and help users navigate their financial journey with confidence.

### **Core Value Proposition**
> "Banking shouldn't require a finance degree to understand. XPlainit uses AI to translate confusing financial jargon into plain English in real-time."
